i created this in p5.js using smple shapes and colour fills. I started by setting up a  canvas and used the ellipse function to draw a large pink circle for the face. i made 2 pink circles for the eyes, and an arc to created a smiling mouth. I used fill and stroke to control the colours and outlines. I experimented with different shades of pink to give the drawing a soft, friendly look. I found choosing and matching the right colours a bit difficult, as small changes in the RGB values made the shades look quite different than expected. however i am overall happy with how the final product looked

I created an animation in p5.js using two moving circles that bounce from side to side across the screen. I used variables to control the circles’ positions and speeds and updating them in the draw loop. I used the fill function to add colour one circle is pink and the other was meant to be purple. however i couldnt find the right shade of puple to use but in this mini project i learnt how to copy the code for each circle in a more easier and ifficiant way insted of it being more difficult.

i made an interactive pastel pink multiples project where i used p5.js and mouse events. it draws pink circles that follow the mouse and change size randomly. Each time I click, the colour changes to a different pastel pink selected from an array of gentle tones. I used RGB values to add transparency, giving the circles a soft, layered effect as they overlap. The interaction makes the artwork feel dynamic and playful. I found choosing the exact shades of pink a little challenging as there was multiples diffrent shades of pink to use because i had to use diffrent RGB codes. this is my favourite mini project as i like how i can make my own desgins and make it look cool.

for the final mini assesment i used a photo i took on holiday as i loved the photo and the holiday to display my own night sky photograph. i also added code to resize the canvas automatically if the window changed. I found adjusting the image size and getting the proportions right the most difficlut part as it changed how the photo looked.
